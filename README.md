* Some Background

AppCore Creator is my entry for the CFBuilder contest by Raymond Camden. The Extension will be used to create Core CF Application files which include Application.cfc, Error Handler and Missing Template handler files for ColdFusion MX 7, ColdFusion 8 and 9 versions. Basically the extension performs file copy operation form extension location to the new location.
